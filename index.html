				<p>The History of our Company</p> 
				<p>SolarSphere360 was founded in 2025 by visionary environmental engineer Dr. Emily Carter and entrepreneur Raj Patel, united by their mission to bring sustainable energy to every corner of the world. The company was born out of frustration with the inefficiency and high cost of traditional solar solutions, which left millions of people without access to clean energy. The company started as a small startup in Boulder, Colorado, focused on designing affordable, portable solar chargers for camping and outdoor activities. Their first product, the SolarSphere Mini, was a compact solar-powered phone charger that became a hit among eco-conscious adventurers. Over the next few years, the team expanded its R&D efforts, leveraging advancements in nanotechnology and energy storage to create more powerful and versatile solar products. In 2030, SolarSphere360 introduced its flagship product, the SolarSphere 360, a spherical solar energy generator designed for households, businesses, and remote areas. The product revolutionized the market with its ability to capture sunlight from all directions and store energy efficiently. This innovation earned the company multiple awards, including the Global Green.</p>
